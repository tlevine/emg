I think I need a pre-amp for the microphone that I want to plug in to the
LR-16. Is this right? If so, where can I buy a cheap (and low-quality)
pre-amp? Or, maybe the thing I need is called something else.
I don't know much about audio equipment, as you may guess.

Do I need a pre-amp?
---------------------
I arrived at the idea that I need a pre-amp by reading the LR-16 manual
and by conducting the following experiment.

I have an LR-16, a personal computer (PC), and a microphone. The personal
computer has a microphone port and a headphones port.

.. csv-table::

    ,                          Micropone output, PC output
    LR-16 input,               Can't hear,       Can hear
    PC input (low mic boost)   Can't hear,       Can hear
    PC input (high mic boost), Can hear,         Can hear (loudly!)

I plugged these things into each other in the various combinations above and
heard or didn't hear the results above.

In addition to using the built-in PC sound card, I also tried
a `cheap USB sound card <http://www.ebay.com/itm/161739128793>`_,
and the results were the same as with the built-in card.

This makes me think that my sound cards have pre-amps or the sound system
software does something equivalent.

Adding to my belief that I need a pre-amp, I see that you can lower the volume
on individual channels within the LR-16 but can't increase their volumes; the
default gain level is 0 decibels, and the only other options are negative
numbers.

Cheap pre-amps
----------------
I want to buy a small, cheap pre-amp for this microphone. I want it to be small
and cheap because bad quality is fine for what I'm doing and because I want
the pre-amp to be easy to carry.
I'm going to have several similar inputs and thus several pre-amps.

I found a bunch of things marketed as pre-amps, but I don't really know what
I'm doing.

But I'm concerned by my inability to find small a cheap thing that takes.
On one hand, this could be a strange thing that few people need and that there
thus is little market for. On the other hand, it could indicate that I'm doing
something more strangely than I need to. This is what I managed to find.

Anyway, I arrived finally at the following cheap board that I think does what
I want. If I connect this board to power, connect the input to the microphone,
and connect the output to the LR-16, should the microphone play loudly enough?
