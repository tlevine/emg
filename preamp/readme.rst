I think I need a pre-amp for the microphone that I want to plug in to the
LR-16. Is this right? If so, where can I buy a cheap (and low-quality)
pre-amp? I don't know much about audio equipment, as you may guess.

Do I need a pre-amp?
---------------------
I arrived at the idea that I need a pre-amp by reading the LR-16 manual
and by conducting the following experiment.

I have an LR-16, a personal computer (PC), and a microphone. The personal
computer has a microphone port and a headphones port.

.. csv-table::

    ,                          Micropone output, PC output
    LR-16 input,               Can't hear,       Can hear
    PC input (low mic boost)   Can't hear,       Can hear
    PC input (high mic boost), Can hear,         Can hear (loudly!)

I plugged these things into each other in the various combinations above and
heard or didn't hear the results above. This makes me think that my PC sound
card has a pre-amp.

In addition to using the built-in PC sound card, I also tried
a `cheap USB sound card <http://www.ebay.com/itm/161739128793>`_,
and the results were the same as with the built-in card.

Also, you can lower the volume on individual channels within the LR-16, but
you can't increase their volumes; the default gain level is 0 decibels, and
the only other options are negative numbers.

Cheap preamps
----------------
I want to buy a small, cheap preamp for this microphone. I want it to be small
and cheap because bad quality is fine and I want it to be easy to carry.
(I'm going to have several similar inputs.)

I found a bunch of things marketed as pre-amps, but I don't really know what
I'm doing.

But I'm confused by my inability to find.
