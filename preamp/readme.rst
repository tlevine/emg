I think I need a pre-amp for the microphone that I want to plug in to the
LR-16. Is this right? If so, where can I buy a cheap (and low-quality)
pre-amp? I don't know much about audio equipment, as you may guess.

Do I need a pre-amp?
---------------------
I arrived at the idea that I need a pre-amp by reading the LR-16 manual
and by conducting the following experiment.

I have an LR-16, a personal computer (PC), and a microphone. The personal
computer has a microphone port and a headphones port.

    ,                          Micropone output, PC output
    LR-16 input,               Can't hear,       Can hear
    PC input (low mic boost)   Can't hear,       Can hear
    PC input (high mic boost), Can hear,         Can hear (loudly!)

I plugged these things into each other in the various combinations above and
heard or didn't hear the results above. This makes me think that my PC sound
card has a pre-amp.
